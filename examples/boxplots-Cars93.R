# --- Price with Manufacturer ----
#
# appearance tips:
#     reorder the categorical x value by the y value.
#
#     rotate the x axis label 90 degrees; use las
#         The las setting sets the axis label style with respect to the axis: 
#         0=parallel, 1=all horizontal, 2=all perpendicular to axis, 3=all vertical
#
#     scale the axis labels by 60% of default text size; use cex.axis
#
# here's our first try:
#   notice that:
#       hard to interpret the graph
#       some x axis labels are missing: what's the one with the huge quartile extent?

# ------------------- Extra explorations... --------------
# # Question: what's the story with some of these wheelbases? 
# # Ford, for instance, has a huge range. Let's look:
#
# ford=cr[cr$Manufacturer=="Ford",]
# summary(ford$Wheelbase)
# # Ford wheelbases really do range from 90 to 114 inches!
# # 
# # # calling factor() enables us to strip unused levels from Make and Type variables
# # # refer here, use the factor() call to lose extra levels.
# # # http://www.r-bloggers.com/drop-unused-factor-levels/
# ford <- data.frame(factor(ford$Make), 
#                   factor(ford$Type), 
#                   factor(ford$Model),
#                   ford$Wheelbase) 
# summary(ford)
# #     factor.ford.Make. factor.ford.Type. ford.Wheelbase ...
# # 1        Ford Festiva             Small             90
# # 2         Ford Escort             Small             98
# # 3          Ford Tempo           Compact            100
# # 4        Ford Mustang            Sporty            101
# # 5          Ford Probe            Sporty            103
# # 6       Ford Aerostar               Van            119

# 
# # here's another way to do the same subsetting operation, with better control of column names:
# # # refer here, use the factor() call to lose extra levels.
# # # http://www.r-bloggers.com/drop-unused-factor-levels/
# model=factor(cr[cr$Manufacturer=="Ford","Model"])   # was a factor
# type=factor(cr[cr$Manufacturer=="Ford","Type"])   # was a factor
# wheelbase=cr[cr$Manufacturer=="Ford","Wheelbase"] # was an int
# 
# # here we could make a data frame containing whatever we want:
# # ford = data.frame(model, type, wheelbase)
# 
# # here's a Ford Wheelbase boxplot with Type:
# par(mfrow=c(1,2))
# 
# colors=rainbow(length(levels(type)))
# mw=reorder(type,wheelbase)
# boxplot(formula=wheelbase~mw, 
#         data=cr, 
#         xlab=xl, 
#         ylab="Wheelbase in Inches",
#         col=colors)
# title("Ford Vehicle Wheelbase with Type")
# 
# # with Model, it's still essentially a boxplot, since x is categorical:
# mw=reorder(model,wheelbase)
# plot(formula=wheelbase~mw, 
#         data=cr, 
#         xlab="Ford Model", 
#         cex.axis=0.8,
#         las=2,     
#         ylab="Wheelbase in Inches",
#         pch=1) # pch gets ignored
# title("Ford Vehicle Wheelbase with Model")
# par(mfrow=c(1,1))

# -------- Extra stuff: Violin Plot ----------

# A violin plot is a combination of a box plot and a kernel density plot. 
# Specifically, it starts with a box plot. It then adds a rotated kernel 
# density plot to each side of the box plot.

# Here is a violin plot of Weight and Type.
# library(vioplot)
# x1 <- cr$Weight[cr$Type=="Small"]
# x2 <- cr$Weight[cr$Type=="Sporty"]
# x3 <- cr$Weight[cr$Type=="Compact"]
# x4 <- cr$Weight[cr$Type=="Midsize"]
# x5 <- cr$Weight[cr$Type=="Large"]
# x6 <- cr$Weight[cr$Type=="Van"]
# vioplot(x1,  x2,  x3, x4, x5, x6, names=levels(cr$Type),
#         col="blue")
