ROC curves and classification

We're going to look at something called a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) graph on our protein crystallization data.

This is a plot of the true positive rate against the false positive rate for the different possible cutpoints of a diagnostic test.

A ROC curve demonstrates several things:

    It shows the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity (any increase in sensitivity will be accompanied by a decrease in specificity).
    The closer the curve follows the left-hand border and then the top border of the ROC space, the more accurate the test.
    The closer the curve comes to the 45-degree diagonal of the ROC space, the less accurate the test.
    The slope of the tangent line at a cutpoint gives the likelihood ratio (LR) for that value of the test. 
    The area under the curve is a measure of test accuracy. 
    
 The area under the curve measures discrimination, that is, the ability of the test to correctly classify those examples 
belonging to one class or the other. Consider the situation in which all examples are already correctly classified into 
two groups. You randomly pick on from the positive group and one from the negative group and do the test on both. The 
example with the more abnormal test result should be the one from the negative group. The area under the curve is the 
percentage of randomly drawn pairs for which this is true (that is, the test correctly classifies the two examples in 
the random pair).
