HWI Crystallization Dataset README

This file will (hopefully) help break down the data into easier terms to understand.
It summarizes the column names and their contents for the data frames that form our 
workshop project dataset.


---------------------------------Experiment data------------------------------------

The experiment data frame describes the crystallization experiments.



-sample_id: 	13 distinct values that identify the proteins.
-plate_no: 	Another set of 13 distinct values that identify proteins.
-generation:	A number for the collection of chemical cocktails used in this
		dataset. We're using data entirely from generation 8.
-read_no: 	39936 values that each identify an individual experiment.
-week_no: 	When was the classification done? Either Week 2 or Week 5.
-cocktail_no: 	1536 unique values that each identify a specific cocktail mixture.
-human_crystal: A human assesses whether or not crystallization occurred. 
		1=yes, 0=no. Consider this to be the truth about crystal state.
-class3_crystal:The computed probability that crystallization occurred in the
		given experiment. The probability is generated by a classification
		program. 
-class3_clear:	The computed probability that a clear drop was present in
		the experiment. 
-class3_other:	The computed probablility that neither a clear drop nor a crystal 
		was present in the experiment.


Total number of experiments in our dataset:
	13(proteins) x 1536(cocktails) x 2(weeks) = 39936 experiments

Imagine sitting down and classifying them all yourself!



-----------------------------------Sample data--------------------------------------



The sample data frame describes the 13 proteins used in the experiments:



-sample_id
-p_number
-pstid
-name
-targetdb_status

All of the above are ways to identify each individual protein. 


-experimental_molecular_weight: molecular weight of the specific protein.
-concentration: 	what is the concentration of the protein in each 
			experiment?
-concentration_units: 	all concentrations are measured in mg/mL.
-molar_concentration:	another way of measuring concentration. 
-seq: 		sequence of amino acids in protein.
-seq_len: 	number of amino acids in the protein.
-targetdb_ref: 	Reference database for the protein. PDB => rcsb.org
-targetdb_status: unique protein code on PDB. Searching this code in the 
		Protein Data Bank on rscb.org will pull up that specific 
		protein and its properties.





-------------------------------------Drop data--------------------------------------



The drop data frame describes the components of the chemical cocktails:


cocktail_no + solution_component_no provides a unique identifier for a given record.

-cocktail_no:	The cocktail identifier.
-generation:	A number for the collection of chemical cocktails used in this
		dataset. We're using data entirely from generation 8.
-solution_component_no: Which part of the cocktail this chemical is (up to n parts).
-concentration: Concentration of the chemical in the cocktail.
-units:		Units of the concentration. 
-name:		The name of the chemical in the cocktail.
-ph:		The acidity of the chemical in the cocktail.

This data frame contains 3930 records, since the chemical cocktails contain at
least 2 (and up to 6) components.


------------------------------------expURL data-------------------------------------


The expUrl data frame contains urls that show what each crystallization experiment 
(with unique protein, cocktail, and time period) looks like at the given time interval.

-read_no: 	identifies the specific experiment
-image_url:	URL of the experiment image
